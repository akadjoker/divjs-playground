# Native functions

Every function a DivJS program can call that is provided by the runtime
(`CanvasEngineRuntime.registerNatives()` in `vm/runtime.js`). The list is
checked against the registered natives by the test
`T5 every registered native is documented` (`tests/runtime-tests.js`): a
native added or removed without updating this file fails the test suite.

Conventions used below:

- **Angles** are DIV angles, in thousandths of a degree (`90000` = 90°). As in DIV, `0` points right and angles grow counter-clockwise: `90000` points up, `-90000` down. `angle`, `advance`, `get_distx`/`get_disty`, `fget_angle`, control points and collision shapes all follow this. `sin`, `cos` and `atan2` are plain maths (they know nothing about screen y).
- **TYPE** is a process type, written `TYPE name` in the program.
- **file / graph**: `file` is a library code returned by `load_fpg` (the first
  one loaded is `0`); graphics loaded one by one (`load_map`,
  `load_graphic`, `load_tile`, `new_graphic`) get codes from `1000` up and
  belong to file `0`, as in DIV.
- **Paths** given to `load_fpg`, `load_map`, `load_fnt`, `load_graphic`,
  `load_tile` and `load_bdf_font` name a project file first (the
  playground's Files tab, a packed game's files, `runDivDemo({ files })`),
  matched by the whole path or the file name alone, in any case and with
  `/` or `\`; otherwise they are URLs relative to the page.
- **Colours** passed as strings are CSS colours (`'#ff8'`, `'red'`); colours
  passed as three numbers are 0-255 RGB.
- Functions that only act on "the current process" use the process running
  the call; called from MAIN they act on MAIN.
- `—` in the Returns column means the function always returns `0`.

## Input

| Name | Arguments | Returns | Description |
|------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `key` | `key` | 1/0 | 1 while the key is held. Takes the `_a`…`_z`, `_0`…`_9`, `_left`, `_space`, `_enter`, `_esc`, `_shift`, `_control`, `_alt`… constants (or the same names as strings). Letters, digits and space are tested by physical key, like DIV's scan codes. |
| `key_down` | `key` | 1/0 | Same as `key()`. |
| `key_pressed` | `key` | 1/0 | 1 only in the frame after the key went down (edge); `key()` stays 1 while held. Not a DIV function. |
| `mouse_x` | — | number | Cursor x in screen coordinates. Same as `mouse.x`. |
| `mouse_y` | — | number | Cursor y in screen coordinates. Same as `mouse.y`. |
| `mouse_button` | `button` | 1/0 | 1 while mouse button `button` (0 left, 1 middle, 2 right) is held during this frame; a click shorter than a frame still reads 1 for one frame. `mouse.left`, `mouse.middle`, `mouse.right` are the same buttons. On a touch screen the first finger is the mouse: it moves the cursor and holds the left button while it touches. |
| `__get_mouse_field` | `field` | value | Compiler-internal: reads `mouse.<field>` (graph, file, size…). |
| `__set_mouse_field` | `field, value` | value | Compiler-internal: writes `mouse.<field>`. |

| `get_fps` | — | number | Measured frames per second. |
| `get_time` | — | number | Seconds since the program started. |
| `get_delta` | — | number | Seconds the current frame advances. |

| `path_stop` | — | 1/0 | Stops following. |
| `path_index` | — | number | Index of the point being walked to. |

## Physics

Rigid-body physics on Planck.js (a JavaScript port of Box2D). A process
gets a body by calling `phys_box`, `phys_circle` or `phys_edge`; from then
on, every frame and before the processes run, the world takes one fixed
step of 1/fps and writes the body's position and angle into the process's
`x`, `y` and `angle`. Setting `x`, `y` or `angle` in the script moves the
body there. When the process dies its body is removed.

Units are the program's: pixels (divided by `resolution`, as for drawing),
pixels per second, and DIV angles (counter-clockwise, `90000` up). Body
types are the constants `phys_static` (never moves), `phys_dynamic` (moved
by forces and collisions, the default) and `phys_kinematic` (moved only by
its velocity). The natives act on the calling process's body; the ones
shown with `[, id]` act on process `id`'s body instead when it is given.

| Function | Arguments | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `phys_gravity` | `gx, gy` | 1 | World gravity in px/s² (default `0, 600`: down). |
| `phys_scale` | `pixels_per_metre` | 1/0 | Pixels in a metre (default 32; Box2D suits objects of 0.1-10 m). Only before the first body. |
| `phys_iterations` | `velocity, position` | 1 | Solver iterations per step (default `8, 3`): more makes joints and stacks stiffer, at a CPU cost. |
| `phys_substeps` | `n` | 1 | Steps per frame (default 1, up to 16), each of 1/(fps·n): steadier fast bodies and long chains. |
| `phys_box` | `width, height[, type]` | 1 | Gives the process a body with a box centred on its `x, y`, rotated by its `angle` (a second call adds another box). |
| `phys_circle` | `radius[, type]` | 1 | Gives the process a body with a circle centred on its `x, y`. |
| `phys_add_box` | `ox, oy, width, height` | 1 | Adds a box at an offset from the body's centre (compound shapes). |

| `phys_edge` | `x1, y1, x2, y2` | 1/0 | Adds a line segment, relative to the process's `x, y`, to a static body: chains of edges make terrain. |
| `phys_material` | `density, friction, restitution` | 1 | Density (mass per area), friction (0 ice, 1 rubber) and bounce (0 none, 1 elastic) for the body's shapes. Defaults `1, 0.5, 0.1`. Called before the body exists, it applies to the shapes made next. |

| `phys_spin` | `angular_speed[, id]` | 1/0 | Angular velocity in DIV angle units per second (`90000` = a quarter turn a second, counter-clockwise). |
| `phys_fixed_rotation` | `on[, id]` | 1/0 | 1 stops the body from rotating (characters that must stay upright). |
| `phys_bullet` | `on[, id]` | 1/0 | 1 enables continuous collision for fast bodies so they do not pass through thin ones. |
| `phys_sensor` | `on[, id]` | 1/0 | 1 makes the body's shapes detect contacts without pushing anything. |
| `phys_mass` | `[id]` | number | The body's mass (density × area in m²). |
| `phys_contact` | `TYPE name` or `0`, `[id]` | id | The id of a process of that type (any type with 0) whose body touches this one now, or 0. |
| `phys_impact` | `[id]` | number | How hard the body was hit in the last step, as the velocity change in px/s it caused: compare against a threshold to break things. |
| `phys_pin` | `id, x, y` | joint | Pins this body to process `id`'s body (0: to the world) at the point `x, y`, around which both can turn. |
| `phys_weld` | `id` | joint | Glues this body to process `id`'s body (0: to the world) as they are now. |
| `phys_rope` | `id[, length]` | joint | A rod: keeps the distance between this body's centre and process `id`'s body's centre fixed - as it is now, or `length` pixels. |
| `phys_slack` | `id[, max_length]` | joint | A rope that can go slack: the centres never get further apart than `max_length` pixels (default: their distance now). |
| `phys_limits` | `joint, lower, upper` | 1/0 | The process that made a `phys_pin` joint only turns between two DIV angles relative to the other body (counter-clockwise; the world for a pin made with id 0). |
| `phys_motor` | `joint, speed, max_torque` | 1/0 | The process that made a `phys_pin` joint turns at `speed` (DIV angle units per second, counter-clockwise) relative to the other body, with at most `max_torque` (0 switches the motor off): wheels, fans, doors. |
| `phys_spring` | `joint, frequency, damping` | 1/0 | Turns a `phys_rope` rod into a spring: frequency in Hz (0 = rigid again), damping 0-1. |
| `phys_unjoin` | `joint` | 1/0 | Removes a joint made by `phys_pin` or `phys_rope`. |
| `phys_at` | `x, y` | id | The process whose body covers the point, or 0 (picking things with the mouse). |
| `phys_raycast` | `x1, y1, x2, y2[, OFFSET hx, OFFSET hy]` | id | The first body the line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) hits (not the caller's), or 0; stores the hit point in `hx, hy`. |

| `phys_remove` | `[id]` | 1/0 | Removes the calling process's body (the process stays). |
| `phys_clear` | — | 1 | Removes every body and joint (a new level). |
| `phys_bodies` | — | number | How many bodies the world has. |

## Online play

Two players, each in their own browser, peer to peer (WebRTC): no game
server. To connect, the players exchange two codes by any means (chat,
e-mail...): `net_host()` opens a panel with an invitation code for the
host to send; the guest calls `net_join()`, pastes it, and sends back the
answer code the panel makes; the host pastes that and the game connects.
Instead of the invitation code the host can send a link (in the playground,
and in an exported game served from a web site): it opens the same game,
and the guest's `net_join()` then uses the invitation without asking.
The codes carry the browsers' network addresses; a public STUN server
(`stun.l.google.com`, changeable with `runDivDemo({ netIceServers })`)
only tells each browser its public address. No game data goes through it.
Two tabs of the same browser can play with `net_host_local` /
`net_join_local`, without codes.

Two ways to play:

- **Messages**: `net_send(type, value)` and `net_receive()`, for turn-based
  games or programs that sync their own state.
- **Lockstep**: after `net_start()`, both sides run the same simulation.
  Every frame each side sends its keys and mouse; a frame only runs once
  both players' input for it has arrived, and it is applied `delay`
  frames after it was read, which hides the network's latency. Gameplay
  reads `net_key(player, key)` for both players (`key()` is still the
  local keyboard, for menus). The host picks a random seed that both
  sides use, and the frame time is fixed at 1/fps.

Lockstep only stays in step when both simulations are made of the same
things: start both sides in the same state (the usual pattern is to wait
for `net_running()` and only then create the game's processes), drive
gameplay only with `net_key`/`net_mouse_*`, `rand` and frame counts (not
`key()`, `mouse.x`, `get_time()` or `get_fps()`). A tab in the
background gets no animation frames from the browser; during lockstep the
game then keeps stepping on a timer of its own (from a small worker), so
the other player is not left waiting - how often a background tab may run
is up to the browser, so the game can slow down while one player is
away. Every 60 frames the two sides compare a hash of their processes
(id, type, position, angle, graphic, size) and numeric globals; if they
differ, `net_status()` becomes 4 and the log says so.

| Function | Arguments | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `net_host` | — | 1 | Hosts a game (player 0): opens the panel with the invitation code and waits for the answer. |
| `net_join` | — | 1 | Joins a game (player 1): opens the panel to paste the invitation and shows the answer code. |
| `net_host_local` | `[room]` | 1 | Hosts in another tab of this browser, on a named room (default `"divjs"`). |
| `net_join_local` | `[room]` | 1 | Joins the tab hosting `room`. |
| `net_status` | — | 0-4 | 0 idle, 1 connecting, 2 connected, 3 closed (the other player left, the connection failed or was cancelled), 4 desync (still connected; the games went out of step). |
| `net_me` | — | 0/1 | This side's player number: 0 host, 1 guest. |
| `net_players` | — | 1/2 | 2 while connected, otherwise 1. |
| `net_close` | — | 1 | Closes the connection (the other side sees status 3). |
| `net_send` | `type, value` | 1/0 | Sends a message: `type` a number, `value` a number or a string. 0 when not connected. |
| `net_receive` | — | 1/0 | Takes the next message received, in order, for `net_msg_*` to read: 1, or 0 when there is none. |
| `net_msg_type` | — | number | The type of the message taken by `net_receive`. |
| `net_msg_value` | — | value | Its value. |
| `net_msg_from` | — | 0/1 | The player who sent it. |
| `net_start` | `[delay]` | 1/0 | Host: starts lockstep on both sides, with `delay` frames of input delay (default 3, 1-15; about 50 ms at 60 fps). The guest's call does nothing and returns 1, so both sides can run the same code. 0 when not connected or already started. |
| `net_running` | — | 1/0 | 1 once lockstep has started on this side (from the frame after the host's `net_start`). |
| `net_frame` | — | number | Lockstep frames run so far (the same number on both sides for the same frame). |
| `net_key` | `player, key` | 1/0 | 1 while `player` (0 or 1) holds the key in this lockstep frame. |
| `net_key_pressed` | `player, key` | 1/0 | 1 in the frame `player`'s key went down (a tap shorter than a frame still counts). |
| `net_mouse_x` | `player` | number | `player`'s cursor x in this lockstep frame. |
| `net_mouse_y` | `player` | number | `player`'s cursor y. |
| `net_mouse_button` | `player, button` | 1/0 | 1 while `player` holds mouse button `button` (0 left, 1 middle, 2 right). |

Limits: two players. Behind some routers (symmetric NAT, common on mobile
networks and some offices) two browsers cannot reach each other through
STUN alone and need a TURN relay server, which is given with
`netIceServers`; the connection then fails with status 3. Lockstep between
two different browser engines (for example Chrome and Firefox) has not
been tested: their maths functions may round differently.

## Sound and music

Sounds are loaded from files (`load_wav`) or made by the engine from a
recipe (`sfx`, `sfx_tone`: no file needed), and `sound` / `play_sound`
play one on a new channel. Music is a small step sequencer: a song has a
tempo and tracks; a track is an instrument and a line of notes, one step
per sixteenth note, and shorter tracks repeat under the longest one.

Browsers only let a page make sound once the player has clicked or pressed
a key on it: until then `sound` / `play_sound` are skipped (they still
return a channel) and a song waits, then starts on its own. Sound never
changes the game's state, so it is safe in online lockstep games.

Note lines (`song_track`): tokens separated by spaces (or `|` to mark
bars). A note is its name, an optional `#` or `b` and the octave (`C4`,
`F#3`, `Bb2`; `A4` is 440 Hz); `-` holds the previous note one more step;
`.` is a step of silence. Drum tracks (`inst_drums`) use `k` (kick), `s`
(snare) and `h` (hi-hat), alone or together (`kh`).

Constants: waveforms `wave_square`, `wave_triangle`, `wave_saw`,
`wave_sine`, `wave_noise`; effects `sfx_coin`, `sfx_laser`,
`sfx_explosion`, `sfx_powerup`, `sfx_hit`, `sfx_jump`, `sfx_blip`,
`sfx_random`; instruments `inst_square`, `inst_triangle`, `inst_saw`,
`inst_sine`, `inst_drums`, `inst_pluck` (short, plucked), `inst_pad`
(soft, slow), `inst_bass` (triangle an octave down).

| Function | Arguments | Returns | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `load_wav` | `path` | sound | Loads a sound file the browser can decode (WAV, OGG, MP3), from the project files or a URL. The frame waits for it, like graphics. |
| `load_pcm` | `path` | sound | DIV's name, same as `load_wav`. DIV's own `.pcm` format is **not** read yet: convert such sounds to WAV. |
| `sfx` | `effect[, seed]` | sound | A ready-made effect (`sfx_coin`...); `seed` gives a variation. The same arguments give the same sound (no new sound per call). |
| `sfx_tone` | `wave, freq, freq_end, ms[, volume]` | sound | A tone of `ms` milliseconds sliding from `freq` to `freq_end` Hz; `volume` 0-100 (default 50). |
| `sound` | `sound[, volume, frequency]` | channel | Plays a sound, DIV style: `volume` and `frequency` 256 = as recorded (frequency 512 is an octave up and twice as fast). |
| `play_sound` | `sound[, volume, pitch, pan]` | channel | Plays a sound: `volume` 0-100 (default 100), `pitch` 100 = normal (200 an octave up), `pan` -100 left to 100 right. |
| `change_sound` | `channel, volume, frequency` | 1/0 | Changes a playing channel, with `sound`'s 256 scale. |
| `stop_sound` | `[channel]` | 1/0 | Stops a channel; 0 or nothing stops every sound. |
| `is_playing_sound` | `channel` | 1/0 | 1 while the channel is playing. |
| `sound_volume` | `volume` | 1 | Volume of all sounds, 0-100 (default 100). |
| `music_volume` | `volume` | 1 | Volume of the music, 0-100 (default 60). |
| `song_new` | `bpm` | song | A new, empty song at `bpm` beats a minute (4 steps a beat). |
| `song_track` | `song, instrument, notes[, volume]` | number | Adds a track (see note lines above); `volume` 0-100 (default 60). Returns the song's number of tracks, 0 if the line is empty. |
| `song_play` | `song[, loop]` | 1/0 | Plays the song (stopping the one playing), looping unless `loop` is 0. |
| `song_stop` | — | 1 | Stops the music. |
| `song_playing` | — | song | The song playing (or waiting for the player's first click), 0 for none. |
